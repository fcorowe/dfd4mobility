This is the website for "Using Digital Footprint Data to Measure and Monitor Human Mobility". This is a training workshop designed and delivered by Prof. Francisco Rowe, Dr. Carmen Cabrera-Arnau, Dr. Miguel Gonzalez-Leonardo, Ruth Neville and Andrea Nasuto.

This workshop offers an introduction to the access and use of digital footprint data to analyse internal population movements. We will cover how to download and develop data products for the analysis of this type of data. The workshop will use an applied, hands-on approach in R via computational notebooks.
