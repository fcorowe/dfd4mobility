Make sure to download the appropriate version for your Operating System. For example, if you use a macOS laptop with an M1 processor, click on ‘Download R for macOS’ and then, click the link to download the installer file (.pkg extension for macOS) under the header ‘For Apple silicon (M1/M2) Macs’. You can then open the installer and follow the instructions that you will be prompted with.\nYou will also need to download RStudio, which is an integrated development environment to help you write code in R more easily. To download RStudio, follow this link [Fr, check link] and scroll down to the section titled ‘All Installers and Tarballs’. Download the appropriate installer file according to your Operating System.
