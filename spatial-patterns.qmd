## Spatial indicators of human mobility

### Origin-based indicators

This measure is in relation to a baseline - percentage change and flow

```{r}
origin_df <- df20 %>% 
  filter(start_polygon_name != end_polygon_name) %>% 
  group_by(start_polygon_name) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean_perchange = mean(percent_change, na.rm = T),
    mean_diff_flow = mean(n_difference, na.rm = T),
    sum_diff_flow = sum(n_difference, na.rm = T),
    mean_outflow = mean(n_crisis, na.rm = T),
    sum_outflow = sum(n_crisis, na.rm = T)
    ) %>% 
  ungroup()

tail(origin_df, 10)
```

### Destination-based indicators

```{r}
destination_df <- df20 %>% 
  filter(start_polygon_name != end_polygon_name) %>% 
  group_by(end_polygon_name) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean_perchange = mean(percent_change, na.rm = T),
    mean_diff_flow = mean(n_difference, na.rm = T),
    sum_diff_flow = sum(n_difference, na.rm = T),
    mean_inflow = mean(n_crisis, na.rm = T),
    sum_inflow = sum(n_crisis, na.rm = T)
    ) %>% 
  ungroup()

tail(destination_df, 10)
```

### Intraflows

```{r}
origin_df <- df20 %>% 
  filter(start_polygon_name == end_polygon_name) %>% 
  group_by(start_polygon_name) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean_perchange = mean(percent_change, na.rm = T),
    mean_diff_flow = mean(n_difference, na.rm = T),
    sum_diff_flow = sum(n_difference, na.rm = T),
    mean_intraflow = mean(n_crisis, na.rm = T),
    sum_intraflow = sum(n_crisis, na.rm = T)
    ) %>% 
  ungroup()

tail(origin_df, 10)
```

### Netflows

```{r}
# mean outflow by area
outflows_df <- df20 %>% 
  filter(start_polygon_name != end_polygon_name) %>% 
  group_by(start_polygon_name) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean_outflow = mean(n_crisis, na.rm = T)
    ) %>% 
  ungroup()

# mean inflow by area
inflows_df <- df20 %>% 
  filter(start_polygon_name != end_polygon_name) %>% 
  group_by(end_polygon_name) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean_inflow = mean(n_crisis, na.rm = T)
    ) %>% 
  ungroup()

# combine data frames
netflow_df <- cbind(inflows_df, outflows_df)

# mean netflow by area
netflow_df <- netflow_df %>% 
  mutate(
    mean_netflow = mean_inflow - mean_outflow
  ) %>% 
  select(start_polygon_name, end_polygon_name, mean_inflow, mean_outflow, mean_netflow)

head(netflow_df)
```

```{r}
#| warning: false

ggplot(data = netflow_df) +
  geom_density(aes(x = mean_netflow),
               alpha=0.5, 
               colour="darkblue", 
               linewidth = 2
               ) +
  theme_tufte()
```

## Mapping

Colour palettes

::: {.callout-note icon="false" appearance="simple"}
## Question 1

Why to create geovisualisations?
:::

For creating maps, cartography is important. A carefully crafted map can be an effective way of communicating complex information. Design issues include poor placement, size and readability of text and careless selection of colors. Have a look the style guide of the Journal of Maps for details.

::: callout-note
For colour palettes, we recommend the following resources:

-   the R packages `viridis` and `RColorBrewer`

-   the website [color brewer 2.0](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3)

### Handling spatial data

```{r}
# set crs
crs_default = "EPSG:4326"
```

```{r}
df20 <- readRDS("./data/fb/movement_adm/2020_04.rds") %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  dplyr::filter(country == "CL") %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("start_lon", "start_lat"), 
                                      crs = crs_default)

glimpse(df20)
```

```{r}
shp_adm <- read_sf("./data/shp/adm/gadm41_CHL_3.shp") %>% 
  st_simplify(preserveTopology =T,
              dTolerance = 1000) %>%  # 1km
  sf::st_make_valid() %>% 
  dplyr::select( c(
    NAME_3, 
    ENGTYPE_3, 
    geometry
  ) ) %>% 
  st_transform(crs_default)

shp_adm
```

Recompute <!--# recompute metrics to preserve the geometry -->

```{r}
# mean outflow by area
outflows_df <- df20 %>% 
  filter(start_polygon_name != end_polygon_name) %>% 
  group_by(start_polygon_name) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean_outflow = mean(n_crisis, na.rm = T)
    ) %>% 
  ungroup()

# mean inflow by area
inflows_df <- df20 %>% 
  filter(start_polygon_name != end_polygon_name) %>% 
  group_by(end_polygon_name) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean_inflow = mean(n_crisis, na.rm = T)
    ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  st_drop_geometry()

# combine data frames
netflow_df <- cbind(outflows_df, inflows_df)

# mean netflow by area
netflow_df <- netflow_df %>% 
  mutate(
    mean_netflow = mean_inflow - mean_outflow
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::select(start_polygon_name, mean_inflow, mean_outflow, mean_netflow, geometry) %>% 
  rename(
    polygon_name = start_polygon_name
  ) 

head(netflow_df)
nrow(netflow_df)
```

Join point-in-polygons

<!--# The join is wrong - look at the names! --> Overlay start points from the mobility dataset over the polygons. Extract start points from the linestring geometry and use that to create the spatial data frame for mobility.

```{r}
mob_indicators <- st_join(shp_adm, netflow_df)
mob_indicators
```

### Choropleths

Choropleths are thematic maps. They are easy to create but also to get wrong. We will look at a set of the principles you can follow to create effective choropleth maps. Here three more questions to consider:

-   What is being plotted?

-   What is the target audience?

-   What degree of interactivity we want to offer?

Map flows - use code from uk migration paper

```{r}

```

<!--# Use rates - need to aggregate the FB for individual months -->

### Interactive mapping

### Flow mapping

<!--# Common concepts -->

<!--# There are several concepts relevant to understanding the data sets. First of all, we construct maps using two different methods of identifying locations: tiles and administrative polygons. -->

<!--#  The Bing Maps Tile System defines a series of grids at different resolution levels over a rectangular projection of the world (Schwartz 2018). Each level is constructed by dividing the previous level into fourths. We typically use Bing tile levels 13 through 16, where level 13 results in tiles that are about 4.9 x 4.9 km at the Equator. The other method we use for identifying a location is administrative polygons, which define the political and geographic boundaries of countries, states, provinces, counties, cities, and more. -->

<!--#  When generating a map for a crisis event, we specify a rectangular bounding box around the most directly affected area. The different map calculations, described in the following sections, are done relative to this region, and, for most of the maps, only data within this region is included. Most of the map types are based on counting events that occur within a time interval, which is frequently 8 or 24 hours. The time interval determines what data is included in a calculation as well as the minimum frequency with which new maps are generated.  -->
